# Matthew-Garcia Website
<br><br>


Matthew Garcia is a web page crafted exclusively employing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This ongoing project is currently in a static state, reflecting its developmental phase.

The design of this webpage draws inspiration from a notable designer's website, reflecting a thoughtful emulation of their aesthetic and layout principles.

This website primarily serves as a showcase of my proficiency in CSS, highlighting the skillful utilization of cascading style sheets in its design and presentation.
